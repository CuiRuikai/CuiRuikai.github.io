# About Me

Hi, I am Ruikai Cui (崔瑞凯), a final-year Ph.D. student at The
Australian National University (ANU), advised by Prof.
<a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/"> Nick Barnes</a>, Prof.
<a href="https://saeed-anwar.github.io/"> Saeed Anwar</a>, and Prof.
<a href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/"> Hongdong Li</a>.
Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from
the ANU and Shandong University in 2021.

My research focues on 3D reconstruction and generation.
