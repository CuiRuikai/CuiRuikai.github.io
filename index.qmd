# About Me

Hi, I am Ruikai Cui (崔瑞凯), a final-year Ph.D. student at The Australian National University (ANU), advised by Prof. <a
                    href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/"> Nick\ Barnes</a>, Prof. <a
                    href="https://saeed-anwar.github.io/"> Saeed\ Anwar</a>, and Prof. <a
                    href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/"> Hongdong\ Li</a>. 
                    
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from the ANU and Shandong University. My primary research interest is 3D Reconstruction and Generation.
